shaker Theme Sphinx Style
=========================

Theme based on Kenneth Reitz theme, which in turns was based
on Mitsuhiko's themes for Flask and Flask related projects.

To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
this guide:

1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
   you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.

2. add this to your conf.py: ::

    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
    html_theme_path = ['_themes']
    html_theme = 'shaker'
